    <p><b> But earlier this month, the high courts </b> of Peshawar, Sindh and Balochistan had suspended by-elections in
        their
        respective provinces <i> while the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had suspended the de-notification of three PTI
            leaders. </i></p>

    <p><strong> The NA seats were vacated after Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf </strong> swiftly moved to accept the resignations of PTI
        lawmakers, <em> pending since April 2022, in an apparent bid to scuttle the opposition’s purported plan to bring a
        confidence motion agai­nst Prime Minister Shehbaz Sha­rif.</em>

        <strong> On March 1, the Islamabad High Court had suspended the de-notification of three PTI lawmakers — </strong> Asad Umar, Ali
        Nawaz Awan and Raja Khurram Shehzad — and sought a reply from the ECP and NA.

        A day later, the Balochistan High Court had stopped the ECP from holding the by-election in NA-265, Quetta,
        along with suspending the ECP’s de-notification of PTI leader Qasim Suri.</p>

    <p>In four separate notifications issued on Sunday, the electoral watchdog said that until further orders from the
        relevant courts, <br> it was suspending the election schedule for one NA seat in Balochistan, three in
        Islamabad,
        nine in Sindh and 24 in KP.</p>
